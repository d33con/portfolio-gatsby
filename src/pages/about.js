      <p>
        I have recently returned to the UK after 4 years living in  Japan. Over
        the last 2 years I have been self-learning web  development and am keen
        to take the first step in a new  career. I am skilled in modern
        responsive HTML, CSS and  Javascript. Focusing on React lately, I
        actively seek out new technologies and keep up to date with the latest
        trends and advancements. I am constantly looking to improve on the
        skills I have learned so far whilst gaining new knowledge and I would
        welcome the chance to do this in a professional environment.
      </p>

        In my spare time I love listening to and occasionally producing music,
        watching Leicester City FC, reading and watching TV.
